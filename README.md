# Phase 2 project: Jawn Pro Wrestling App


## Setup 

All the Wrestler information information can be found in the `db.json` file. 

You can use `json-server` to create a RESTful API for our database.

Fork then Clone this Repository.

Run `npm install` to install our dependencies.

Then, run `npm run server` to start up `json-server` on `http://localhost:4000`.

In another tab, run `npm start` to start up our React app at `http://localhost:3000`.

Or Just go to https://jawnprowrestling.herokuapp.com/ in your browser of Choice


## Project Goals

Creat a basic App for a Regional Pro Wrestling Company. This case that of JAWN Pro Wrestling. Northeast Promotion based out of the Philadelphia Area.
Goal is to have a site with multiple pages that can be easily navigated by just clicking on the Nav bar at the top of the page. There would be a page to 
Promote and stear you directly of Sponsors.
Another page to promote upcomming shows, and Final Page were inspiring Wrestlers can put in to have there names known and have there contact info be logged for furture bookings.
These people can also be sorted for easier viewing. 

## Project Requirements

To make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app
App should use multiple components in a way that keeps your code well organized
There should be multiple client-side routes using react-router (Links to an external site.)
Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.

Stretch Goals

Incorporate data from an external API. Use this list of APIs (Links to an external site.) if you need some inspiration!
Add some styling: you're encouraged to write your CSS from scratch, either by using styled-components (Links to an external site.) or writing CSS files and using id/className to style your elements. You can also incorporate a UI framework (like react-bootstrap (Links to an external site.), semantic-ui (Links to an external site.) material-ui (Links to an external site.))

## Trying to Figure Out Where to Start

In exploring the page, click any of that you wish to expore with the Nav Bar and go.
